Build It Break It Fix It
Coursera Capstone Course

NOTES:
1. The specification for this project implies that the executable must be 
runnable from any directory.  This implies that our executable file, regardless
of format, must not have any non-system dependencies regardless of where it is 
located.

To support this, we create a monolithic script with all our Python classes which
otherwise would never be created.

Typical Python, Java, etc. usage would not take this approach, but it has been
done to comply with the contest specification. 


2. Since the Coursera-supplied virtual machine (after updates) configures
Linux's binfmt_misc support to recognize compiled Python files, we default to
building a pre-compiled Python file for performance reasons.  If your test 
environment/VM does NOT support this and spits out errors trying to run these 
files, run "make all_plaintext" to get monolithic Python executable/source-code
files to test with instead.
