The Oracle bank implementation binds to the IP 127.0.0.1.

Our implementation bound to 0.0.0.0 (all valid IPs).  This caused us to 
respond back to the ATM on locally valid IPs that Oracle would not.

This one-line fix changes the bank to bind to 127.0.0.1 like the Oracle.

--- Longer explanation ---

The Bank specification does not specify which IP to listen on, and does
not provide a parameter to set it.  

But the ATM is allowed to connect to different IP addresses.

So I asked on the official IRC channel what to use, suggesting
127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 (all valid IPs).  Andrew Ruef or someone else using
his nickname replied to use 0.0.0.0.

Apparently this was not what we were expected to use.
