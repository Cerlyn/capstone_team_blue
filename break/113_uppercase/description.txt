The specification states:

"File names are restricted to underscores, hyphens, dots, digits, and 
lowercase alphabetical characters (each character should match 
/[_\-\.0-9a-z]/). File names are to be between 1 and 255 characters long.
The special file names "." and ".." are not allowed."

The test submission uses a card file name of "dAn" with an uppercase A.

Therefore this account/card file should never have been accepted.
