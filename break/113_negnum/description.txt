This ATM accepts negative numbers for parameters, and does odd things 
with them:

./atm -n -5.00 -a ted
{"account":"ted","initial_balance":4294967291.00}
{"account":"ted","initial_balance":4294967291.00}

The ATM Protocol spec states:
Numeric inputs are positive and provided in decimal without any leading 0's
(should match /(0|[1-9][0-9]*)/). Thus "42" is a valid input number but the 
octal "052" or hexadecimal "0x2a" are not. Any reference to "number" below 
refers to this input specification.
