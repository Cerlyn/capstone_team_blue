"Command line arguments must be POSIX complaint" per the rules at
https://coursera.builditbreakit.org/static/doc/fall2015coursera/spec/index.html

The POSIX specification contains --

Guideline 5:
One or more options without option-arguments, followed by at most one option 
that takes an option-argument, should be accepted when grouped behind 
one '-' delimiter.

Therefore "-ga ted" should be accepted to get the balance of the ted account.
