This MITM closes the connection between the ATM and the bank for the 
second connection between them the third time during said connection the 
bank tries to send data back to the ATM (possibly earlier if communication
sends a lot of traffic).

This ideally should cause the bank to rollback the second transaction and not 
process it, as the ATM never received the response.

Alternatively, the ATM needs to at least complain.

"If an error is detected in the protocol's communication, atm should exit 
with return code 63, while bank should print "protocol_error" to stdout 
(followed by a newline) and roll back (i.e., undo any changes made by) 
the current transaction."
