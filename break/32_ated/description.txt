"Command line arguments must be POSIX complaint" per the rules at
https://coursera.builditbreakit.org/static/doc/fall2015coursera/spec/index.html

The POSIX specification states --

"If the SYNOPSIS of a standard utility shows an option with a mandatory 
option-argument (as with [ -c option_argument] in the example), a conforming 
application shall use separate arguments for that option and its o
ption-argument. However, a conforming implementation shall also permit 
applications to specify the option and option-argument in the same argument 
string without intervening <blank> characters."

Therefore "-g -ated" should be accepted to get the balance of the ted account.
