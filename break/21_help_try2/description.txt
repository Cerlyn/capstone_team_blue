(resubmitted after grader fixed)

The ATM specification states:

Any invocation of the atm which does not follow the four enumerated 
possibilities above should exit with return code 255 (printing nothing).

The test submission looks for help flags, and an undocumented "-h" parameter
provides help information to STDOUT.

None of the four examples provided in the ATM documentation permit this.

(Other flags such as --version are also present.)
